                <h2>OBITUARY</h2>
                <p>Growing bored of watching each other’s breath freeze in their Edinburgh flat, Czech-born, classically trained singer / composer Anna Novotna and half-Brazilian, cult-escaping drummer / lyricist Stella Williams formed HINTENVELTER in late
                    2019 and set out to make pop spooky again.
                    <br>
                    <br> After a blackout debut open-mic performance, the duo realised they had plenty of substances but not enough guitar so they swiped Andrew Murray-Brown across the world and into the group (devastating the other 6 people in New Zealand's
                    music scene). Isaac "Sunshine" Kryzton walked into the band 5 days before their debut gig at the Leith Depot with the promise that he could "play" bass, had a lot of free time and would "pay them back" for any drinks. Part Russian,
                    part Arab, part Swede, 100% keyboard virtuoso Sandy came onboard soon after, freeing up Anna's hands to make as much noise and dark ambience as a second-hand Roland synth can make.
                    <br>
                    <br> Inspired equally by David Lynch and B-movies as we are OGs (original goths) Siouxie-Soux and Hungarian composer Gyorgy Ligeti, HINTENVELTER's music features moody synths and catchy hooks with soaring harmonies tight enough to
                    squeeze through an organ pipe backed by sulky bass lines and capricious drums.
                    <br> With lyrics that each read like a tale from the crypt telling stories of drugged romantic partners, dead romantic partners, soon to be dead romantic partners and healthy eating you’re gonna want to get ahead of the game and have
                    a listen before Anna ends up on the stand in a Netflix murder doc.
                    <br>
                    <br> The band's debut EP ‘Eulogy for AMB’ is named in loving memory of guitarist Andrew who was tragically taken from the band before his time by Covid-19.
                    <br>
                    <br> Recorded in Edinburgh’s premier recording studio-cum-café-cum-apocalypse shelter, Music Base with producer Alasdair Kelly (notorious with those in the know for his band Barbe Rousse and his work on ‘The Jamie G – LP’) these five
                    tracks will make you want to dig up your dead granny so you can dance with her one last time. Put a bed sheet over your head, cut out some eye holes and give it a listen!
                    <br>
                    <br> Andrew isn't dead btw he just had to go back to New Zealand.</p>
